Capstone project "Finance calculators"
HyperionDev Skills Bootcamp
The program is a financial calculator that helps users calculate either the interest earned on an investment or the monthly repayment on a home loan (bond). The program prompts the user to choose between 'investment' and 'bond', takes relevant inputs based on the chosen option, and then performs the necessary calculations.
